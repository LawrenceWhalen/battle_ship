### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Battle Ship

Group Member Names: Dee Hill, Lawrence Whalen

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
  * Developing a strong workflow. Strong completion of iteration 3. Better clean up of testing debris. Both of us have a strong understanding of our code.
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
  * Collaboration style of ping pong. Team strengths are adaptability, applying knowledge, inspirational, and strong pattern identification.
  * When appropriate we will switch to both speaking code without defined roles.
How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
  * Good communication and talking through difficulties will play to our strengths when obstacles occur.
Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
  * 5:00pm to 7:00pm and 8:00pm to 10:00pm. No morning work and weekends will be evaluated at end of week.
Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
  * Communication through slack and check-ins at the start of each work block.
Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  * Slower more careful variable creation. Turning a prompt into a map and then code.
Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  * Using Ping Pong so workload should be equal.
Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
  * Navigator developes test, and then the writer creates code to pass the test. Writer creates next test and pushes to git. Pull request when a method is finished.
Pomodoro Break Schedule:
  * 30 on 5 off/take breaks when either partner requires
Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  * Honesty and respect. Feedback can be delivered through any form.
Additional Remote Considerations:
  * Respect of privacy if needed.
Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
  * Github

Day 1 Agenda:
  * Talk through and plan out Class for setup and iterations.
